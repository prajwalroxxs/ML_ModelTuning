# ML_ModelTuning
This project demonstrates how to apply multiple supervised machine learning models to classify breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. The notebook covers model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

 Results
1. All models are compared using standard classification metrics.
2. Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning (via GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV) shows improved performance.
3. You can modify the notebook to test other models or datasets.
